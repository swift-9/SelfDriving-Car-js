## 📌 Overview

A browser-based **self-driving car simulation** built using **plain JavaScript** and the HTML5 Canvas API.

- 🚗 Infinite road with traffic
- 🧠 Neural network visualizer in real-time
- 🔄 Models evolve with **mutations** each run
- 💾 Best model gets saved locally (localStorage)
- 🎮 You act as the **trainer** — refresh to improve generations!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. On first load, cars start with random neural networks.
2. Best-performing car is saved as the "model".
3. On reload, new cars spawn with **mutated versions** of the saved model.
4. Over generations, performance improves — a simple **evolutionary training loop**.
